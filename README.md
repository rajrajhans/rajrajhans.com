###About the project

I have always wanted a presence of my own on the web. The earlier version of rajrajhans.com was developed using WordPress. This new redesign is based on blazing-fast [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and uses Netlify for hosting. It uses [Netlify's Lambda Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) for powering the [contact form](https://rajrajhans.com/contact) on the website.
